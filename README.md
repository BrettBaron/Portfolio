# My Portfolio Page

## Description

This was my first attempt at creatinng a website from scratch. Although I'm happy with troubleshooting, I'm not ultimately happy with the end result.

-This makes me feel challenged and motivated to continue to improve.
-I understand team effort, and needing to access outside resources a little more.
-This project challenged me, and I enjoyed it. I've found weaknesses I can improve on. I've found areas in which I can understand more. This was a good challenge for the week, and I look forward to improving this website into something flawless.
