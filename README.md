## Description

This was my first attempt at creatinng a website from scratch. Although I'm happy with troubleshooting, I'm not ultimately happy with the end result.

-This makes me feel challenged and motivated to continue to improve.
-I understand team effort, and needing to access outside resources a little more.
-This project challenged me, and I enjoyed it. I've found weaknesses I can improve on. I've found areas in which I can understand more. This was a good challenge for the week, and I look forward to improving this website into something flawless.
-To whom is grading this - I know this NOT up to standards with the criteria. I won't make excuses. However, I did try to challenge myself to make something unique, which ultimately lead to some serious flaws. I accept the current grade. All I ask is, can you please give me some corrections in the issues that you see. My "about me" doesn't flex correctly, and my images I cannot change in sizing (might be due to the .card I gave them). I found a lot of 'copy-paste' answers, but decided to take this fate...
